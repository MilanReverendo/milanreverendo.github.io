            <h3>Why IT?</h3>
            <p>I was interested in computers when I was younger, so when I had to choose something in 
                secondary school this is the first thing that came to mind.
            </p>
            <h3>Hobby</h3>
            <p>
                Next to my education I am also a leader at my local youth movement called Chiro Gestel
                which I enjoy a lot in my free time.
